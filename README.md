# Information Retrieval and Text Mining course (DAT640), University of Stavanger

This repository contains course material (lectures, labs, and assignments) for the 2021 fall edition of the course (previous editions: [2020](https://github.com/kbalog/uis-dat640-fall2020) and [2019](https://github.com/kbalog/uis-dat640-fall2019)).

Announcements and assignment deliveries are on [Canvas](https://stavanger.instructure.com/courses/8838).

## Course format

The course follows a **flipped classroom** format, where students learn the course material independently and asynchronously prior the in-class sessions (watching pre-recorded lecture videos and reading the textbook/notes/articles).  Classroom time is devoted to active learning, including discussions and answering questions, laboratory exercises, and assignments.

The semester is divided into two periods, with lectures and individual assignments during the first ten weeks (weeks 34-43), and group project work during the last three weeks (weeks 44-46).

### Lecture period

  * **Tuesdays (14:15-16:00) Digital lectures:** This is a slot for individual studying (watching the videos and reading the textbook/articles). There is no physical lecturing, so you may take this at your own chosen time, as long as it happens before the classroom session on Wednesday.
  * **Wednesdays (14:15-16:00) Classroom (Discussion & Exercises):** Discussion session and exercise time, led by the lecturer (KB). Physical attendance is expected (but live streaming is provided). [Further information](exercises/).
  * **Thursdays (12:15-14:00) Classroom (Individual assignments):** Dedicated time to work on individual (graded) assigments, led by the TA (IK). Physical attendance is expected (but live streaming is provided).

### Group project work 

*Detailed schedule will follow later.*

### Equipment

You need to bring your own device to the classroom sessions. 

This course assumes that you have some familiarity with programming in Python and that you have Python 3.7+ installed on your device (Anaconda distribution recommended). Further package requirements will be specified in the respective exercises/assignments.

## Grading

The overall grade comes from two components, both of which need to be >F in order to pass:

  * 40% Project work. Half of the score comes from the individual assignments and another half from the group project.
  * 60% Written (digital) exam.

## Contact, feedback, and getting help

  * For all course-related matters, [Canvas](https://stavanger.instructure.com/courses/8838) is the main communication platform. You can either use the mail option or even better, comment on the announcement so that other students can also see it.
  * We welcome feedback on all levels! You may use the forms on Canvas to leave feedback on lectures, exercises, and assignments.
  * Thursday labs are for working on the assignments. This is *the* time to get help! It's much easier face-to-face than over email.
  * If you need to talk to the lecturer, make an appointment via email. Due to a busy schedule, if you drop in unannounced, you should expect to be turned away.
