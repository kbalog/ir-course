# L8: Entity-Oriented Search Part III: Semantic Search

The last module in the entity-oriented search series focuses on semantic search.  Here, we will discuss techniques that help search engines understand the user's intent behind the search query and provide not only more accurate search results but also an overall improved search experience.  Specifically, we will cover a selection of techniques under two broad themes: understanding information needs and leveraging entities to improve document retrieval.

## Summary

Key concepts in this lecture:

  * Target type identification task
  * Unsupervised approaches for target-type identification (type-centric and entity-centric models)
  * Features for supervised target-type identification
  * Evaluation measures (strict and lenient) for target-type identification
  * Methods for mapping entities to queries
  * Projection-based methods for leveraging entities in document retrieval (explicit semantic analysis, latent entity space model, EsdRank)
  * Entity-based representation methods for leveraging entities in document retrieval (entity-based language models, coordinate match, entity frequency, explicit semantic ranking, word-entity duet framework)
