    "# Naive Entity Linker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll need to create the simplest possible entity linker, which recognizes city names in text and links those to the corresponding Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we aim for a minimalistic solution, we won't be dealing with the problem of disambiguation explicitly.  Instead, we construct a surface form dictionary such that each mention is mapped to a single entity.  Then, the task boils down to (i) the construction of the surface form dictionary, and (ii) the recognition of mentions (dictionary keys) in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use part of the Wikipedia URL after the last slash to uniquely represent entities, i.e., as `entity_ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to have a minimalistic working solution first, then expand it iteratively.\n",
    "- For the minimal version, consider only capitals in Europe. (All those cities should have unique names.)\n",
    "- Expand the list of cities by considering other Wikipedia lists and/or DBpedia properties. At this point, we don't deal with ambiguity; if a city name has already been added to the surface form dictionary, we ignore it.\n",
    "- Finally, we resolve ambiguity by considering the more popular sense of the entity. Since we don't have link information easily available, we'll use the population of the city as a proxy. That is, if there are multiple cities with the same name, keep the one in the surface form dictionary with the highest population."
